# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview

###The purpose of this analysis is to break down data and present it in a way that is both visually appealing and makes sense. We are analyzing data for a ridesharing company that we work for. We are breaking down the data in a way that provides insight into the weekly fares of all rides broken down by city type (urban, suburban, or rural). In order to do this we use Pandas, Python, and Matplotlib. 

##Results

###Looking at the data summary for the information we found, we can see that urban cities have almost 2.5x the rides as suburban cities and 13x the rides as rural cities. The number of drivers in urban cities is also significantly more than drivers in both rural and suburban cities. The average fare per ride is less in urban cities and cost the most in rural cities, benefiting drivers the most.

###Looking at the multi-lineplot created we can come to the same conclusion even though the data is delivered in a different way. This multi-lineplot shows fares by week in the year of 2019 for all three city types. As shown in the data summary dataframe, urban cities collect the most in fares while rural cities collect the least.

##Summary

###Recommendation 1: Looking at the data, it looks like drivers in urban areas do not benefit much per ride. One suggestion would be to cap the number of drivers there are in an urban city to keep drivers profitable. 

###Recommendation 2: There are not many drivers in rural areas despite the profitability. I suggest to increase advertisements in these areas for drivers. 

###Recommendation 3: This data could be a little more detailed. It would be beneficial to track mileage of rides as well and look at average mileage. It would also be beneficial to look at average population to determine if there should be a cap of drivers determined by population.
